<h1>The Best Movies According to Ryan</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all time*</h2>
 <p><i>*If I can remember any movies I've seen</i></p>

 <hr />

 <h3>Inside Out</h3>
 <p>Literally waterworks every time. Really well done and such a great analogy for our internal landscape as humans.</p>

 <h3>Mean Girls</h3>
 <p>The original one, of course. Although I do love the musical, but the movie adaption was a bit trash.</p>

 <h3>My Neighbor Totoro</h3>
 <p>This one grew on me gradually. It captures what it's like to be a child and see magic everywhere so perfectly.</p>
